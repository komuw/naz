    A simple implementation of BaseCorrelater.
    It stores the correlation/relation between a given SMPP sequence_number and a user supplied log_id and/or hook_metadata.
    The storage is done in memory using a python dictionary.

    SimpleCorrelater also features an auto-expiration of dictionary keys(and their values) based on time.
    When instantiating a SimpleCorrelater, you can supply a max_ttl which is the time in seconds that an item
    is going to be stored. After the expiration of max_ttl seconds that item will/may be deleted.

    The storage looks like:
        {
            "sequence_number1": {
                "log_id": "log_id1",
                "hook_metadata": "hook_metadata1",
